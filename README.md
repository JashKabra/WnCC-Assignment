# WnCC-Assignment
This is my submission of task 2 of assignment for the post of convener in WnCC.  
This task involved scraping the website https://www.covid19india.org to get the cases in the districts of any state in India.

To run the code locally:
  1. Download the zip file from github and extract it. Make sure that all the files are in the same directory.
  2. Fire up your terminal and install a couple of python libraries using pip install selenium and pip install webdriver-manager.
  3. Navigate to the location of directory in your terminal and run the python script 'scrape.py'.  
  4. All the states will be displayed along with their index and you have to choose the index of the state you want cases of. After choosing, a file named after that state will be created which will contain the required data.
 
 States.csv contains the information of all the states required to navigate within the website.  
 Maharashtra.csv is just a sample file containing what the output would look like.
